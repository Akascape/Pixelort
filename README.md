## What is Pixel Sorting?
Pixel sorting is a digital image processing technique that involves isolating a horizontal or vertical line of pixels in an image and sorting their positions based on any number of criteria, such as luminosity, hue, or saturation 1. The result is a glitchy, abstracted image that can be used for artistic purposes.
